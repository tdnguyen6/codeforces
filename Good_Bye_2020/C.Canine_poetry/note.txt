- break intersection b/t concatenated palindrom strings
- how to detect palindrom? bab and baab
- special case: palindrom with similar chars
    - every char in between is a concat char
    - however, if that char, it is still a palindrom: bbb -> bzb, another case ababa -> recheck after every change
    bbbbbbb
    bzbbbbb
    bzybbbb
    bzybtbb
    bzybtub
- len is 1 return 0

abaacd
stack of int (index)
detect by comparing the next char with top or top - 1 of stack

- same -> change -> redo
- detect -> change -> bab change b, baab change a -> redo
